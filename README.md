# Stock-Market-Predictions-with-LSTM
I have taken data from Alphavantage. I have predicted the change in stock price, whether go up, or down.
To predict from previously sorted data by date for next day via standard Average or Exponential Moving Average.
but to predict more than one day we need a better model, that is LSTM(Long Short-Term Memory models are extremely powerful time-series models)
I have tuned my hyperparameter according to my that set to get a better accurate result.
